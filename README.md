  ## Description
  🔮 This application serves as a pet adoption website for prospective pet owners to browse available cats and dogs.  We wanted to provide an interactive application for users to view a gallery of all pets, view by only cats and only dogs, and a single detailed view of each pet. 

  ### User Story
    AS A prospective pet owner
    I WANT to be provided with options of cats and dogs in need of homes
    SO THAT I can chose a pet to adopt.
